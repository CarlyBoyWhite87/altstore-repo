PLEASE help us by submitting any issues you find on [Github][1] (after searching).\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n* iPadOS 13.4: touchpad scroll gesture and right click as well as mouse middle and right click. UTM is ready to support Magic Keyboard on day one!\r\n* Added inertia to scrolling. Includes scroll wheel emulation from touch gestures and gamepad joystick.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Shared directory not working (#265). Note that previously, we advertised support for shared directories outside the app sandbox. This feature has been moved to a future milestone as it requires much more work. As a result, v1.0 will only support shared directory inside the app sandbox.\r\n* Bug in additional arg parsing broke args with spaces (#266)\r\n* Gamepad thumbstick does not move the mouse cursor if the thumbstick is locked in place (#262)\r\n* When \"retina mode\" is enabled, device rotation does not change resolution (#275)\r\n* On iPads, device rotation does not change resolution (#275)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* Note that USB/BT mouse scroll wheel does not work well but this seems to be an iOS issue in general.\r\n* Many issues in console mode. In v1.0, those bugs will not be fixed.\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues","downloadURL":"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/download/v1.0-rc1/UTM.ipa","size":127532753}],"news":[]}
